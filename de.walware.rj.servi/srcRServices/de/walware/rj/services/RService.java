/**
 * A interface with methods to evaluate and exchange data with R.
 * <p>
 * It depends on the application how to get access to the RService.
 * In StatET it is passed as adapter argument in 
 * {@link de.walware.statet.nico.core.runtime.IToolRunnable#run(de.walware.statet.nico.core.runtime.IToolRunnableControllerAdapter, IProgressMonitor) IToolRunnable#run(...)},
 * if the R console supports the featureset {@link de.walware.statet.r.nico.RTool#R_DATA_FEATURESET_ID RTool#R_DATA_FEATURESET_ID}.
 * In applications using R in the background by the RServi library, 
 * the {@link de.walware.rj.servi.RServi RServi} object provides the RService methods.</p>
 * <p>
 * If the application has also an console, the operations of an RService
 * usually doesn't appears in the console. Even not recommended, it is possible
 * to call special R functions like print which output is written to the console.
 * It should absolutely avoided to use functions like <code>readline</code> which requires 
 * interaction with the console.</p>
 * <p>
 * The methods of an RService should not be called concurrently by different
 * threads. The RService consumer have to make sure that the function calls
 * are synchronized, if multiple thread have access to the same instance.
 * Implementations of RService interface can perform checks too, but the consumer 
 * must not rely on that.</p>
 * <p>
 * Especially for longer evaluations, it is recommended that the application implements
 * this synchronization in a way that the GUI is not blocked.
 * In StatET both is guaranteed by a queue and an single execution thread for runnables.</p>
 * <p>
 * All data exchange methods are copy operations. So changes on R data objects in Java
 * are not reflected in R and the other way round.</p>
 * <p>
 * In general it is not necessary to surround R expressions with try-catch or similar construction
 * except the error object is expected as return value.</p>
